## Analysis overview
The bioinformatic analyses of this work is divided into xxx steps:
  1. **Data preprocessing:** This part described how individual sample was QC and processed before data integration.
  2. **Data integration:** This part described how samples were integrated and annotated (Fig. 2)
  3. **Downstream analysis:** This part included DE analysis in Fig. 3
  4. **Epithelial cells subset analysis:** This part shows epithelial cells subset analysis in Fig. 4 and 5A
  4. **Integrated with public dataset:** This part shows data integration with publicly available data as shown in Fig.5B


## Packages used in this analysis
* Seurat
* SCTransform
* SoupX
